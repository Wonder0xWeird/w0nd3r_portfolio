The thick, almost tangible ultramarine haze shifted just enough to let Marceline make out the edge of some looming structure before her. As she glided forward, other sharp edges began to become just barely visible in her peripheral vision. Each structure oozed with a rapidly evaporating green expungent that seemed condensed, almost curdled, onto the rigid shapes from the chaotic haze that swirled around her.

With a sudden big WHOOSH, an incandescent stream of chalky green smoke burst from somewhere below her, gripping her tight and making her weightful as her flesh singed with the knowledge of gravity. In the next step, her foot exited the exhalation of smoke, followed by the rest of her, and into a new dimension she arrived.

In that moment, the haze that she had been moving through for the last unknown amount of time seemed to rapidly retreat away and those sharp sharp edges that she had struggled to resolve just moments before now crisply presented themselves as a dense thicket of massive razor blades that protruded from the rumpled gray ground all around her and blocked out the sky above. While the gooey green crud she had seen all over these massive living murder trees no longer decorated their now steely surfaces, Marceline could feel down in to the depths of her marrow the aura of the chaos magic roiling off them, making for certain that, wherever she happened to be, she was meant to be there.

"Uhhh, Chaos, what were we supposed to grab here again?" Marceline called out over the sound of the whooshing that continued to spill out behind her. "Yeesh, really Robert? A razor blade dimension? What could you possibly need from here…" she said, scrunching her face in confusion.

Without a response she inquired once more, turning and looking downward for her chaotic familiar, "Chaos?" But instead of a frog-shaped demon, her eyes met a pock-marked, circular opening in the ground that was actively ejecting a warm, transparent, gaseous substance. Although the gas seemed to lack in any visible appearance, she could again feel the depth of chaos magic that composed it.

"Uhhhhh, Chaaooos?" repeated Marceline, a tinge of worry cresting the confusion in her voice as she angled her head to peer down the gassy pore, and then followed up with, "Uhhhmm, I can't do this without you dude, where the 'f' did you go!?"

As if in response, the ground beneath her began to warp, twisting and bristling the blade trees and causing them to sheer against each other to emit an eerie but mostly harmless screeching sound. Some of the smaller knifey trees and shrubs directly around her arms and legs swayed against her, causing her to feel a series of intense cutting sensations but left her flesh unperturbed. "Huh. Where do I know that feeling from?" she wondered aloud.

But before Marceline could really comprehend what was actually going on, the scissor wood in front of her moved with the ground to expose an opening between the bramble that reflected a dim but noticeable light into the metallic tangle in which she stood, beckoning her.

Without much else to go on, she listened to her gut and followed the narrow pathway between the tall blades, doing her best to avoid touching anything sharp. While the gouging sensation she felt when in contact with the blades wasn't all together unpleasant, the feelings of nostalgia they evoked were more than a little bit unnerving for the fact that she couldn't exactly place their origin.

Each slice on her arm, leg, or face evoked a different shadowy dream of her in some other Gahlb-forsaken dimension doing or finding some ridiculous shit for Robert or one of the Andtheneum's clients. While she clearly felt herself in these visions, they were unnerving because she couldn't remember having made the memories to feel nostalgic about in the first place. How could one fondly reminisce over something that they didn't even do? Or, did she actually do all those things but somehow lost the original memories she made about them somewhere along the way? Good thing she had a strong and willful yet forgiving spirit, for these mental states would surely break a lesser creature. All she could was what she always did, keep stepping through the doorways and gateways and pathways that found themselves opening up before her.

With one final step, the feelings of nostalgia ended abruptly as Marceline emerged from the grove and into a meadow-like space surrounded by more blade-trees and centered on a large warty gray mound. The open space also revealed a pair of frumpled gray mountains some distance away and an equally gray, featureless sky above.

She slowly stepped further into the open space, scanning her surroundings, and spoke aloud again, "Okay… Am I supposed to know what to do now? I followed your path but none of this makes any sense to me either," in case someone or something had been listening last time.

Again, as if in response, the ground warped underneath her and the mountains she could see in the distance began to move slowly across the tops of the blade-trees and with respect to one another, as if rotating about some unseen axis at their base far away. As the twin peaks rotated, a clear white area covered with a fine network of green veins began to come into view along one of the ranges. The white spot grew and bulged until finally she realized she wasn't looking at a mountain range at all, but rather at a warty eye socket that held the massive, pupil-less eyeball of her chaotic familiar staring blankly back at her.

"Chaos!" she shouted in delighted surprise as she realized she had been adventuring across the back of a massive metallic expression of her familiar all along.

"MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAARRRRRRRCCCCCCCCEEEEEEELLLLLLLLIIIIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEEE," came Chaos's deep croak in response, the booming sound stunning her into sudden awareness of her goal in coming here; what it was that she was sent here to retrieve for Robert.

And then she started to feel the whole world turn upside down. Nothing was really moving around her at first, but she felt herself start to lighten and lift off the rumpled gray surface that made up Chaos's backside. And then she was good and truly falling upwards, now clear above the tips of the tallest blades, the glittering sparkle of splinters and shavings and shards of various sizes now falling alongside her. Faster and faster she fell, revealing more and more of her familiar's full form in this dimension - a gigantic grey toad with deadly-sharp features and stubby, muscular limbs that bulged with each slow and powerful contraction, propelling it forward and away from her into the weird grayness that made up the space around her.

As Chaos slid further away, Marceline finally caught a glimpse of the true scope of the space she was now falling through - filled with a collection of razor sharp, galaxy-sized swords drifting by each other in close proximity to one another, so dense that no color but a dull shiny grey could be seen anywhere she looked. And yet, the metallic structures and the space they occupied were so gargantuan that the space still felt empty and sparse in a contradictory way that she couldn't bear to keep looking at without feeling gut-wrenching vertigo and nausea.

So, she turned her attention to her immediate surroundings and the task at hand, seeking out one of the glinting splinters spiraling through space with her and carefully claiming it as her own. Her momentum was starting to reach a terrifying velocity, so she pulled the splinter in toward her chest and kept her focus tightly on it as she called out to her familiar once more, "Chaos! I got one of your splinters! Take me back to Robert! NOW, PLEASE!"

In her peripheral vision, Marceline caught the planet-sized toad alter his trajectory with one gliding swoop of his strong limbs to start heading directly toward her, quickly closing the distance between them, his bulging eyes as empty as ever but still intent on heeding her call. As his massive form loomed over her, filling her field of view, a deep rumble began to echo from within Chaos's belly.

Then his mouth opened with a deafening, "ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBBBBB-" engulfing Marceline in sharp, forest-green flames as he swallowed her whole and transported her notherwhere else.
