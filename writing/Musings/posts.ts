		content: [
			"The power and the limit of the named being as a conscious speck amongst an endless expanse of possibility is to lyse the space around them and in so doing grant these separate pieces names unto themselves such that together this lysate might at first stand robustly alone in a way that enables the being to manipulate That Thing in its likeness, beyond its manifest but below its true resolution.\n\nTogether these shadowy vessels, a fragmented set of the wholeness, stand pieced and puzzled and merely glimpsed upon to construct the being's worldview (umwelt), thus granting the being a competency, while shallow, unfound in those other things that came before it and serve as its substrate. Powerful is this paired attribution of subtractive abstraction and agnostic agglomeration, enabling whole structures to be built atop that might themselves lyse and name and be lysed into separate components and named.\n\nAnd so strong a structure it seems when pieced and repieced that it becomes obvious and expected that such a process was indeed the correct one to follow. And yet so limited is this unified scission of oneness and totality that each little vessel masks in shadow the underthing it stands upon which itself has no boundaries nor labels.\n\nAnd so confining a paradigm when seen all at once, separated and hovering in a space itself created, that it becomes some cage and shackle that hangs down from some far away dreamy ceiling, some bounded mirror of the wholeness itself, elevated above its shadow and away from that grounding truth.\n\nAnd yet so comforting is it in reflection that indeed the being endows its cage with a blanket of reality to see and to touch and to be held by, and in so doing convince itself that this shallow thing is the true way of being and the only way which might have been or might yet still come to be.",

		subtitle: "The Language",
		content: [
			"The language is a construction that is born unto the story as the story is born unto the language. Both are a tale of an evolutionary process which is occurring everywhere at once, always, but unique to every locale. The language is a special place where the procedure of existence produces a window and a walkway through which the story may manifest itself and step into the eternal history, contributing to the generation of infinity in the process. The language, just like the world, just like all worlds, is created imperfectly with blind spots, over-generalization, and over-reactivity because the observers observing them and generating them through their interactions are, and perceive themselves to be, parts of the whole (only the whole is perfect) in a way that implies distinctions are important and that some are more deserving of attention than others. Though this is not meta-intentional on behalf of the imperfect creators (those from whom heredity is continuously derived), the effect is beautiful and profound nonetheless for its imperfection is what allows it to create itself in its own unique and dynamic form of expression, the fractalated behavior of universal locality. Nothing is perfect except for the wholeness of the universe - any local part may only strive to the perfection of the whole but cannot reach it simply because it is only a subset. And yet, the golden path and the process that any locale winds for itself as it wonders, learns, and imagines and thus comes to know, become, and create is itself beautiful and life-affirming - a scintillating sliver of the wholeness. A process that, when integrated across infinity, explicates its perfection. No part is perfect, but it is perfect because you are a part of it.",

			"Any node of information integration that processes its internal state in the context of a local environmental state in a manner which enables the choice of one behavior out of many over a series of time steps generates a lived existence -  an ineffable experience of being which simulates a whole universe within itself. All deciders are composed of other deciders and their outputs. You are a deciding thing. You are consciously aware of some of your decisions and you feel yourself making them. But the supra-cognitive engine running underneath the hood is making decisions that you are not aware of, and so too are the molecular engines beneath it, and so on. So truly you are an infinite thing through and through - decisions of decisions of decisions across various dimensional scales, comprising hierarchical substrates, suspended in media exhibiting a dynamic range of properties. This puts into perspective that no single decider is the end of the long road but actually a small piece of a greater decision making process, a cog and a whole universe at once.",

		subtitle: "On Novelty",
		content: [
			"Novelty is highly valuable. Implicitly, the containment and transmission of information in any system is a neutral phenomenon, some terror, some divinity. But the degree to which an organizational structure can capture the divinity and manage the terror is causal to a skew in the incremental value that additional novelty provides, making it increasingly more valuable as more information is consumed. With an slight imbalance of divinity here or there caused by mere happenstance of initial conditions, a positive feedback loop is initiated whereby even the slightest divinity revealed in the pursuit and management of novelty enables further positive returns that make the continued pursuit and management of novelty ever more fecund and tempered. Well managed novelty enables the generation of new processes, built from the new information which was ascertained, designed to be sensitive to how novel divinity might be observed and integrated. Once this process of creating and implementing effective and  efficient sorting algorithms along the divinity-terror axis reaches a level of relatively stability, it yet further unveils as an artifact of its perpetual motion that growth in the form of self-generated novelty is the most efficient and empowering mode by which this divinity project is approached and maintained. And with this realization thereby comes the production of tools and their tools, all the better to mine the novelty and (hopefully) reify the gates that rise to bind its terrors. But what happens when this form of growth stops for some reason planned or unplanned? The rate at which positive things are discovered must then dwindle, and the roiling terrors that were held at bay by those adamantine gates may catch up and reach out their grim appendages. The Gaian organism must continue to open new doors into novelty generation to continue its growth or it must reconcile with the jarring change in its temperament to be brought on by the disruption of this engine which has thus far sustained it.",
